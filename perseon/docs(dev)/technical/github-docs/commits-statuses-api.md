# GitHub REST API Endpoints for Commit Statuses

The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "[About API versioning](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/api-versions)."

## Use the REST API to interact with commit statuses.

---

## About commit statuses

You can use the REST API to allow external services to mark commits with an `error`, `failure`, `pending`, or `success` state, which is then reflected in pull requests involving those commits. Statuses can also include an optional `description` and `target_url`, and we highly recommend providing them as they make statuses much more useful in the GitHub UI.

As an example, one common use is for continuous integration services to mark commits as passing or failing builds using status. The `target_url` would be the full URL to the build output, and the `description` would be the high level summary of what happened with the build.

Statuses can include a `context` to indicate what service is providing that status. For example, you may have your continuous integration service push statuses with a context of `ci`, and a security audit tool push statuses with a context of `security`. You can then use the REST API to [Get the combined status for a specific reference](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/statuses#get-the-combined-status-for-a-specific-reference) to retrieve the whole status for a commit.

Note that the `repo:status` [OAuth scope](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps) grants targeted access to statuses **without** also granting access to repository code, while the `repo` scope grants permission to code as well as statuses.

If you are developing a GitHub App and want to provide more detailed information about an external service, you may want to use the REST API to manage checks. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for checks](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/checks).

## Get the combined status for a specific reference

Users with pull access in a repository can access a combined view of commit statuses for a given ref. The ref can be a SHA, a branch name, or a tag name.

Additionally, a combined `state` is returned. The `state` is one of:

- **failure** if any of the contexts report as `error` or `failure`
- **pending** if there are no statuses or a context is `pending`
- **success** if the latest status for all contexts is `success`

### Fine-grained access tokens for "Get the combined status for a specific reference"

This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:

- [GitHub App user access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app)
- [GitHub App installation access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-an-installation-access-token-for-a-github-app)
- [Fine-grained personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)

The fine-grained token must have the following permission set:

- "Commit statuses" repository permissions (read)

This endpoint can be used without authentication or the aforementioned permissions if only public resources are requested.

## List commit statuses for a reference

Users with pull access in a repository can view commit statuses for a given ref. The ref can be a SHA, a branch name, or a tag name. Statuses are returned in reverse chronological order. The first status in the list will be the latest one.

This resource is also available via a legacy route: `GET /repos/:owner/:repo/statuses/:ref`.

### Fine-grained access tokens for "List commit statuses for a reference"

This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:

- [GitHub App user access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app)

## Create a commit status

Users with push access in a repository can create commit statuses for a given SHA.

Note: there is a limit of 1000 statuses per `sha` and `context` within a repository. Attempts to create more than 1000 statuses will result in a validation error.

### Fine-grained access tokens for "Create a commit status"

This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:

- [GitHub App user access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app)
- [GitHub App installation access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-an-installation-access-token-for-a-github-app)
- [Fine-grained personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)

The fine-grained token must have the following permission set:

- "Commit statuses" repository permissions (write)

### Parameters for "Create a commit status"

| --- |
| `accept`string<br>Setting to `application/vnd.github+json` is recommended. |

Headers

Path parameters

| Name, Type, Description |
| --- |
| `state`stringRequired<br>The state of the status.<br>Can be one of:`error`,`failure`,`pending`,`success` |
| `target_url`string or null<br>The target URL to associate with this status. This URL will be linked from the GitHub UI to allow users to easily see the source of the status.<br>For example, if your continuous integration system is posting build status, you would want to provide the deep link for the build output for this specific SHA:<br>`http://ci.example.com/user/repo/build/sha` |
| `description`string or null<br>A short description of the status. |
| `context`string<br>A string label to differentiate this status from the status of other systems. This field is case-insensitive.<br>Default: `default` |
