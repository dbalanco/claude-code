# GitHub REST API Endpoints for Issues

The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "[About API versioning](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/api-versions)."

## Use the REST API to manage issues and pull requests.

---

## List issues assigned to the authenticated user

List issues assigned to the authenticated user across all visible repositories including owned repositories, member
repositories, and organization repositories. You can use the `filter` query parameter to fetch issues that are not
necessarily assigned to you.

**Note**

GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

- **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
- **`application/vnd.github.text+json`**: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.
- **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include `body_html`.
- **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include `body`, `body_text`, and `body_html`.

### Fine-grained access tokens for "List issues assigned to the authenticated user"

This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:

- [GitHub App user access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app)
- [Fine-grained personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)

The fine-grained token does not require any permissions.

## Create an issue

Any user with pull access to a repository can create an issue. If [issues are disabled in the repository](https://docs.github.com/articles/disabling-issues/), the API returns a `410 Gone` status.

This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://docs.github.com/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. For more information, see "[Rate limits for the API](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api#about-secondary-rate-limits)" and "[Best practices for using the REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api)."

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

## Get an issue

The API returns a [`301 Moved Permanently` status](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api#follow-redirects) if the issue was
[transferred](https://docs.github.com/articles/transferring-an-issue-to-another-repository/) to another repository. If
the issue was transferred to or deleted from a repository where the authenticated user lacks read access, the API
returns a `404 Not Found` status. If the issue was deleted from a repository where the authenticated user has read
access, the API returns a `410 Gone` status. To receive webhook events for transferred and deleted issues, subscribe
to the [`issues`](https://docs.github.com/webhooks/event-payloads/#issues) webhook.

**Note**

GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.
